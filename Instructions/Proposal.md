# Project Proposal: "Global Explorer: Adventure Through Geography"  


## Problem Statement
The management team of the Hive group of secondary schools has noticed a lack of engagement in non-STEM subjects over the last two years. They would like to try and reverse this trend and have asked an external team to come up with a solution that places student enjoyment at the heart of the learning experience.

## Solution Proposal
 Create an interactive game where students explore various aspects of geography through multiple quizzes, analyze global connections, and reinforce their learning.


### MVP Features  
### 1. Interactive Quiz 

### 2. Quiz System
- **Questions**: The game consists of 30 multiple-choice questions—each with 4 answer options—divided into three levels of 10 questions each.
- **Scoring**: Points are saved to the database and displayed as scores.

### 3. User Roles  
- **Students**: Take quizzes,win scores
- **Teachers**: View class progress
- **Parents**: Basic dashboard showing children's achievement

### Features after MVP
- Average score from all quiz results
- Easy Medium Hard categorisation
