# Project Execution Plan

## Inital
Set up database connection first (SUPABASE initially)
Define database schema and relationships (ERD diagram).
Implement authentication and authorisation early (signup/login with JWT or OAuth).
Create a Trello board with columns: Backlog, To Do, In Progress, Review, Done.
Assign user stories and track progress.
Design wireframes and create a high-level solution diagram.

## Development

Implement core functionalities first (backend API and frontend UI).
Establish API endpoints and test responses.
Write two tests per day, aiming for 60%+ test coverage.
Test authentication, database interactions, and key features.
Follow Agile workflow with daily standups, tracking progress and blockers.
Make frequent commits with clear messages.
Maintain a well-structured README file for both backend and frontend.
